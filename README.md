My name is Crystal :) I'm a first year Master's of Public Health student with a concentration of Environmental and Occupational Health and a minor in Toxicology. I'm also active duty Navy and here on a commissioning scholarship. Once I graduate, I'll be commissioned and return to the Fleet as an Environmental Health Officer (the civiian equivilant is an Environmental Health Specialist). Thank you for allowing me to join your class :) I'm looking forward to working with everyone!
